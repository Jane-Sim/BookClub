# EXERCISE 2.3

Let’s try one more. This sentence again consists of three words and nine different characters. Look at this sentence for five seconds and try to remember it:

## *cat loves cake*

The third sentence was a lot easier than the other two, right? You can remember this sentence with great ease. That’s because you can chunk the characters in the third sentence into words. You can then remember just three chunks: “cat,” “loves,” and “cake.” The amount of three elements is well below the capacity of your STM, so it’s possible to remember all of this sentence easily, while in the first two examples the number of elements likely exceeds the limits of your STM.

**Answer**

cat loves cake 라는 단어를 5초까지 기다리지 않아도 바로 기억할 수 있고 말도 할 수 있었다.
