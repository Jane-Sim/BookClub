# EXERCISE 2.2

Now try to remember this sentence by inspecting it for five
seconds:

<font size="6">abk mrtpi gbar</font>

I’d guess that second sentence was easier than the first one. That’s because this second sentence consists of letters that you recognize. It may be hard to believe, but these two sentences were the same length: 3 words, 12 characters, 9 different characters.

**Answer**

자음들만 있고 일반적인 영어 단어가 아니라 기억이 나지 않는다. 첫 단어가 abk 두번째 단어가 mrtpi 라는 것 정도
